We are tasked to create a CLIPS program for a vending machine. We are given a Finite State Machine from which we must work from. 
The problem solutions must be thoroughly documented, as well as the code and there must be evidence that the group has worked together 
to achieve this solution. All this must be documented in the GitHub site/app.
We are creating a program that take coin amounts as user input. The amount of coins is supposed to increase as each coin is inserted. 
As the amount increases it should consider what the sum of all the coins are. The program must check the selection of the user, 
the user can select from a small range of products being cola, orange, sweets and chocolate. Each item has a individual amount.
Information Items Cola R8.50 Orange R10.00 Sweets R12.50 Chocolate 15.00

â€¢	Inputs 10c 20c 50c R1 R2 R5

A customer selects an item for purchase and inserts a bill/coins into the vending machine. 
The vending machine dispenses the purchased item and gives change if necessary above-mentioned amounts applies for 
each item and the machine gives all change in in Rands coins (R1, R2, R5) including cents (10c, 20c,50c). 
There are two desired outputs at this stage. 

(1) The number of Rand coins and cents as change 
(2) Your purchased item.
